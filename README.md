# Sentiment Analysis with GloVe

Project to study the power of GloVe word embeddings 
in predicting the sentiment of a restaurant review.

Author: √Ålvaro Parafita

Usage:

The 'python' folder contains the language_tagger.py Python module, 
which gives the tool to tag more entries with a language.

In order to execute it, one should use Python3 
and run the following command line in a UNIX terminal:

python3 python/language_tagger.py data/reviews.json.gz data/language_tagging.json


The 'scripts' folder contains the R scripts that analyize the dataset 
(data_exploration.R) and the ones that compute all the steps in the model:
    - language_imputation: language identifier model.
    - embeddings: creates the document embeddings.
    - sentiment_analysis: uses the results from the previous scripts 
        to create the sentiment analysis models.


Folder 'plots' contains all the plots created in the R scripts.


In order to reproduce the results explained in the report, 
one should only execute all the scripts in the scripts folder in the order
depicted above. At the start of each script, the needed packages are loaded.
One should install all those packages before running the script.

Note that this project worked with a huge dataset and, 
thus, some instructions take minutes or even hours to execute.
